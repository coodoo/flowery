What is this?
--------------

Flowery prettifies the result generated by [Facebook Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) type check tool, making it easier to read.

__Before:__
It's not easy to understand which part of the code went wrong.
```
/Users/folder/zzz.js:14:2,11:
class property initializers are not yet supported

/Users/folder/zzz.js:22:9,24: function call
Error:
/Users/folder/zzz.js:22:14,15: number
This type is incompatible with
/Users/folder/zzz.js:7:19,24: string

Found 2 errors
```

__After:__
Each error was listed with related file name and precise locations.
```
Created: Tue Sep 01 2015 19:37:14 GMT+0800 (CST)
Total Errors: 2

Error:
  /Users/folder/zzz.js, line 14
  t1 = '00';
  ↑ class property initializers are not yet supported

Error:
  /Users/folder/zzz.js, line 22
  var k = foo( 33, 'a22' );
               ↑ expecting "string", got "number"

  From:
    /Users/folder/zzz.js, line 7
    function foo( bar:string, coo:number ):Array<string> {
```

How to use?
-----------

```bash
$ npm install -g flowery
$ flow | flowery
```

By running this command `flow` will check all `js` files in the folder, pipe the results to `flowery`, then you will see  prettified contents on screen, also a file named `flow-results.txt` will be generated in the project folder too so your build tool could pick up from there and make further use of it.

As a side note, flowery can be invoked via both `CLI` or `API`, see `example/api.js` for usage guide.

The core `api` returns both `arrErrorObj` and `arrMessages` so you can further integrate with other toolchains, for example, build a better `flow linter` for Sublime Text Editor.

How to build
------------

```js
npm run build
```

Flowery is written in `ES2015`, hence it's required to run build to generate `ES5` version before publish on NPM.

Roadmap
-------

1. Make it colorful, I've yet to figure out how to make colorful text in console

2. A Sublime Text Editor package which mark errors in place and provide tooltips when mouse hovered it. (Total python noob here, any help would be highly appreciated)
